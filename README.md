# Project Development Plan Readme

## Week 1: Starting Jan 10th
- **Thursday - Friday:**
  - Finish the front end of the bank API. At least to what is expected from the Exalidraw draft.
- **Saturday:**
  - Start learning Kafka and find a way to implement it into the dotnet Bank (Maybe if withdrawal is invalid, notify email that account ID cannot withdrawal due to insufficient balance).

## Week 2: Starting Jan 15th
- **Monday - Saturday:**
  - Continue learning Kafka and OAuth. When comfortable with both, start learning Redis for caching.
  - (^^) Watch and follow along with testing in C# at [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/learningpaths.html?id=csharp-web-ui-path).
  - Scrum Test.

## Week 3: Starting Jan 22nd
- **Monday - Saturday:**
  - By the end of Friday, the Bank should have all the features that were asked for.
  - (^^) Continue learning C# testing and automation. Read about STORED PROCEDURES in Chapter 12 of the SQL book.
  - Maybe rebuild the bank frontend with Angular? This will continue through February.
## Week 4: Jan 29th - 31st
- **Monday - Wednesday:**
